Threads

1.Creating Thread

This is used to intialise the thread variable with the desired
function.

	How to declare thread variable?
	pthread_t thread_variable;
	pthread_t is the datatype of the thread.
Syntax:- int pthread_create(pthread_t *tidp,const pthread_att_t *attr,
	 void *(*start_rtn) (*void),void *restrict);

*tidp :- Stores the address of the pthread_t variable that is declared.
*attr :- It contains certain attributes that your thread can contain
		example:- Priority, size ,etc.
*(*start_rtn) :- every thread is going to start with function and address 
		of the function is passed as 3Rd argument.
*restrict :- Arguments of function that are defined in 3rd parameter.

Note : Every thread created has three unique attributes:- Program Counter,
	Stack and Register.

example:- pthread_t p;
	  pthread_create(&p,NULL,<Function name>,<function_parameters>);
	
	Note :-1. 2nd Parameter of the function will always be NULL because
		we are not assigning any attributes to the created thread.

	       2. If you want to pass the argument into the function then use 
		  structure and pass the address of the object.If not use NULL.
2. Joining Thread
After intialisation of thread,a call to pthread_join() blocks the calling 
thread until the thread with identifier equal to the first argument
terminators.

Syntax:- int pthread_join(name_of_the_VAriable,attribute);
