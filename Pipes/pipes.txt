Pipes - Used in Interprocess Information Communication
Types 
1. Named Pipe
	-Have a name
	-System Call :- mkfifo("Name of Pipe","Permissions");
			mkfifo("Pep1",0777);
		fifo - First in First Out 		
	-Used for communicating between Parent and Child process
		or between two unamed processes.
	-These are bidirectional.
	-Can communicate between the process on different networks too.
	-Named pipes exists in the system even if every I/O operations is 
		done.

2. Unamed Pipe
	-Don't Have name
	-System Call:- pipe(fd);
			(Creates a unamed pipe and
			 returns 2 fd- fd[0] and fd[1])		
	-Used for communication between parent and child process.
	-They are unidirectional.
	-They can communicate on local network processes only.
	-If I/O operations are done and parent/child process terminates 
		that time only the unamed pipe vanishes.	
	fd- File Descriptor

Pipe has two parts
1. write part
2. read part
